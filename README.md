# cli-template

`cli-template` is a template for creating command line interfaces in Rust

## Usage

Clone this project, then copy `cli.yml` into `cli.yml` to set up your required command line flags and arguments.

Once that's done, you can implement everything in `main.rs`.

Make sure to update `Cargo.toml` to set your author name etc.

To build your project binaries, use `cargo build --release`. Your binary will be in `/target/release`.
